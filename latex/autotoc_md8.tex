\item Make sure that all unit tests are passing and that there are no merge conflicts between your branch and {\ttfamily master}.
\item Open a pull request from {\ttfamily Y\+O\+U\+R\+\_\+\+N\+A\+M\+E/branch\+\_\+name} to {\ttfamily master}.
\item A repository maintainer will review your pull request and, if all goes well, squash and merge it!

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries All code must have test coverage.} We use unittest. Changes in functionality should have accompanying unit tests. Bug fixes should have accompanying regression tests.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tests are located in each module with one file per class.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Please don\textquotesingle{}t change the S\+DK Version. We\textquotesingle{}ll take care of bumping the version when we next release.

We follow the \href{https://github.com/raywenderlich/objective-c-style-guide}{\tt Ray Wenderlich style guide} since they have put a lot of thought into making their code more legible. While we aim for our \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_optimizely}{Optimizely}} S\+DK to be performant and bug free, we also want all customers and third party developers read and understand our code easily.
